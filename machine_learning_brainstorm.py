"""
For now, instead of actively solving the game, figure out how to discern patterns between profiles.
Consider:
  
   


#NOTE: Need to make Mission profiles and Player profiles.  


Analyze past games with full data: how spies behaved and how players behaved.
Do the same analysis without knowing whether the teams are good or bad.  
Graph out the results and check for a score difference or other pattern.


Player-centric: analyze the player's votes solely based on player actions.  (Probably need the mission consideration as well)
Do a least-squares regression between the current player, past spies, and past knights.

Mission-centric:  Analyze who approved the team, the memebers, and the outcome.
